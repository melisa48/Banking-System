# Banking System
- This is a banking system implemented in C++ that allows users to perform various banking operations such as creating accounts,
depositing and withdrawing money, transferring funds between accounts, applying for loans, calculating interest, 
updating account information, and closing accounts.

## Features

-  Update Account Information: Account holders can update their account information, including name, address, contact details, and password.
- Close Account: Account holders can close their accounts, and any remaining balance will be handled appropriately.

## Getting Started

- g++ main.cpp Bank.cpp Account.cpp Transaction.cpp -o BankingSystem
- ./BankingSystem
- Follow the on-screen prompts to navigate through the banking system menu and perform various operations.
